During my undergraduate year, I did several projects applying the knowledge I have learned at school. The following are just some that are listed.

1: Gitlet(Course Project)

This is a very popular(notorious) project in Berkeley. It is intended as the last project in CS61B: Data Structures, one of the most fundamental courses in CS major. The goal of this project is to design a small Git,(that is why it is called gitlet). It can support some very basic function, such as init, add, commit, rm, log, find, status, checkout,branch and so on. 

You can read the detailed instructions here.[Gitlet:Your Own Version Control System](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/sp20/materials/proj/proj3/index.html)

2: User Churn Retention Analysis for SoFi(Part-time Internship)

This is a project I have done at Data Science Society at Berkeley, one of the most popular data science clubs, incorporating with the SF unicorn company, SoFi. This is a perfect project using data science skills to solve real problems that are happening in finance industry. The most central goal is to reduce user retention rate by analyzing different products, using mahcine learning models, as well as giving recommendations. 

You can read part of the output here .[SoFi: User Retention Rate](/assets/SoFi_Project_Overview.pdf)

3: Predict Wine Qualities(Course Project)

This is the last project in STSCI 5740: Data Mining and Machine Learning.
